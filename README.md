# Beatify
 A Spotify2BeatSaber Playlist Converter

# Set Up
The requirements are in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Sajeg/Beatify/blob/main/requirements.txt) but you also need a file `Credentials.json` placed in the root of the Project with:

`{"SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET" : "Your Spotify Client Secret", "SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID" : "Your Spotify Client ID"}`
You get these by creating an app on [Spotify Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/create).
